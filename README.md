JFLAP (Java Formal Languages and Automata Package) :
JFLAP is a software tool used for designing and simulating computational models such as finite automata, pushdown automata, Turing machines, and regular expressions. It is primarily used in computer science education to study formal languages, automata theory, and computational logic.
Use Cases of JFLAP:
Education: Teaching formal language theory, automata, and computation.
Research: Experimenting with automata transformations and language recognition.
Software Development: Designing parsers and compilers using formal grammar techniques.
Pushdown Automata (PDA)
A Pushdown Automaton (PDA) is a computational model that extends Finite Automata (FA) by adding a stack as an auxiliary memory. It is used to recognize Context-Free Languages (CFLs) and is more powerful than a finite automaton but less powerful than a Turing Machine.

Working of PDA
A PDA operates similar to an NFA but has an additional stack for memory. It can push, pop, or replace stack symbols during transitions.
Reads an input symbol (or Îµ for non-determinism).
Checks the top of the stack and performs an operation:
Push: Add a symbol to the stack.
Pop: Remove the top symbol.
Replace: Modify the top stack symbol.
Transitions to a new state based on the current input and stack condition.
Accepts the input if:
It reaches a final state (state-based acceptance).
The stack is empty (empty stack acceptance).
